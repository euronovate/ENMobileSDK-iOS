Add `pod 'ENDigitalSignage'` to your **PodFile**

It's a blackbox system to show a media slideshow based on a server-oriented media sync. When connected, it downloads every playlist offline.

The only one function you have to call is:

```swift
public func present(in viewController: UIViewController)
```
