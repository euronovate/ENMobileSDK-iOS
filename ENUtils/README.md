Add `pod 'ENUtils'` to your **PodFile**

This module contains many utilities used by every single module. For example some functions to decode or encode a base64 string, or write/read/delete a file from `FileManager` (very useful in PDF update/signature). You could find useful functions for your own code, but for the flow you shouldn't call any of these functions.
